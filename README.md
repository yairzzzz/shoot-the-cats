# 🐱 Cat Shooter Game

This is a small browser-based game built using **Vue 3** and **Vite**. The goal is to shoot bouncing cat images using a rifle that rotates in real-time based on the mouse position. Each hit increases your score.
Please note that the layout is minimalist since I focused on the logic.

## 🎯 About This Project

This was a fun task given to me by a friend — I took it as a challenge to test my current skill level in Vue, reactivity, animation, and game logic.  
I built everything from scratch, including collision detection, bullet movement, angle calculations, and dynamic image loading.
